1. Copy your original STEAM version game files into this folder. DO NOT RENAME!!
2. Double click the PATCHAPPLY.bat file, a CMD window will open and will start patching automatically.
3. Once patching is complete you will find your new files in the main folder and the originals in a folder called 'old'.
4. Enjoy.
