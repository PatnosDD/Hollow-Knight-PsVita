# Hollow Knight for the PS Vita
This repo contains patches that you can use in order to get fully working files for my port.

NOTICE: OVERCLOCK IS NECESSARY

# Instructions
First, you might want to install the .VPK using VitaShell. Don't try to launch the game, because it will crash without the neccesary files.

## STEAM VERSION
- Download Hollow Knight vpk from vitadb and install it.
- Go to the Release page and download ``HollowKnightVitaSTEAM.zip``.
- Extract it.
- Put the game's folder(```../steamapps/common/Hollow Knight```) inside the extracted folder(Should be Steam version, make sure there is no Config.ini file in files. if there is one, just delete it.)
- Launch ``ApplyPatch.bat`` and wait(Will need from 15 to 25 minutes depending on the system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ``HollowKnightDATA.zip``.
- Turn up VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file```(Zip file should be around 400MB before unpacking)``` over to ``ux0:app/HKVT12222/`.
- Click on "Replace the files in destination" when it asks you to.
- Launch the game and have fun!
