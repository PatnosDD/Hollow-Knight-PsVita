# Hollow Knight for the PS Vita
This repo contains patches that you can use in order to get fully working files for my port.

**YOU NEED TO BUY THE GAME ON STEAM, OR GOG TO MAKE IT WORK!**

NOTICE: OVERCLOCK IS NECESSARY, ONLY WINDOWS VERSION IS SUPPORTED

# Instructions
First, you might want to install the .VPK using VitaShell. Don't try to launch the game, because it will crash without the neccesary files.
